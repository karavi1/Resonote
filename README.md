# Resonote
Resonote (Research + Note + Resonance) is a research-focused, modular reading and reflection data-agnostic system designed to help you build intentional and critical reading habits, retain insights, and connect ideas across any field. Resonote encourages critical engagement by combining content ingestion, thoughtful curation, structured indexing, and lightweight reflection â€” with support for future expansion into knowledge graphs and external integrations. It will serve users to build effective, consistent reading habits and enhance memory, accuracy, and critical thinking.

Tech: Built with a **Flask backend** and **SvelteKit frontend**, Resonote focuses on transparency, personalization, and long-term learning across any knowledge domain.

## Core Features

- Modular ingestion (web, PDFs, feeds, etc.)
- Smart filtering and deduplication
- Indexing for search and retrieval
- Reflection tools (summarization, prompting, spaced repetition)
- Personalized tracking and insights - Mind Map

## Project Breakdown

```bash
app/: Root application directory containing all backend logic and structure.

db/: Database layer with SQLAlchemy models, session setup, and schema init.

services/: Core backend services organized by domain (ingestion, curation, etc.).

ingestion/: Scrapers and ingestion logic for fetching raw content from external sources.

curation/: Cleans content and extracts metadata (title, tags, read time).

routes/: Flask API route handlers for articles, ingestion, and status updates.

main.py: Flask app factory that initializes routes and app config.

run.py: Entry point to start the Flask API server (python run.py).

pipeline_run.py: Script to run ingestion + curation pipeline manually for testing.

```
